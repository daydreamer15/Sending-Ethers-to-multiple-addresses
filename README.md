This is a simple blockchain project that can send ethers to multiple ethereum addresses. Just like for sending an email you use the email address of another user, for sending ethers you use an ethereum address. So using this application users would be able to send ethers to a list of ethereum addresses. This application can be very useful in the case of sending salary to employees. Now to build this project you need to write an ethereum smart contract.

Solidity and ethereum are the technicalities used.
